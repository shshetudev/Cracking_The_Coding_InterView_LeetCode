### Time Complexity
* Time complexity is the amount of __time taken by an algorithm to run__, as  a function of the length of the input.
* It measures the time taken to execute each statement of code in an algorithm.

### Introduction:
* __Space and Time define any object in the universe__.
* Space and Time complexity can define the effectiveness of an algorithm.
* While we know there is more than one way to solve the problem in programming, __knowing how the algorithm works efficiently can add value to the way we do programming__.
* __Space complexity__ of an algorithm quantifies the amount of space or memory taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input.

### Importance:
* __An algorithm, in computer programming, is finite sequence of well-defined instructions__
* Typically executed in a computer, to solve a class of problems or to perform a common task.
* We know different factors can influence the outcome of an algorithm being executed, it is wise to understand how efficiently such programs are used to perform a task.

### Big O Notation:
* Time complexity is given by time as a function of length of input.
* There exists a relation between the input data size(n) and number of operations performed (N) with respect to time.
* This relation is denoted as __Order of growth__ in Time complexity and given notation O[n], where: 
> `O = Order of growth`
> `n = Length of input`
* It is called __Big O Notation__.
* Big O Notation expresses the run time of an algorithm in terms of how quickly it grows relative to the input __n__, by defining the __N__ number of operations that are done on it.

### Type of time complexities:
There are different types of time complexities used:
1. __Constant time - O(1):__
2. __Linear time - O(n):__
3. __Logarithmic time - O(logn):__
4. __Quadratic time - O(n^2)__
5. __Cubic time - O(n^3)__
